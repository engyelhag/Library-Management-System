# Library-Management-System
#Python project - Develop a Simple Library Objective: Management System Apply the concepts learned in the Python course to develop a simple library management system. Project #Description: you will create a console-based application to manage a library's book inventory. The system should allow-users to add, remove, search for books, and manage borrowed #books. Requirements: Data Structures: Use lists and dictionaries to store and manage the library's book inventory and borrowed books. Functions: Create functions for each #operation (e.g., add_book, remove_book, search_book, borrow_book, return book). File Handling: Implement file handling to save and load the library's inventory and borrowed books #data. Error Handling: Use try-except blocks to handle potential errors (e.g., file not found, invalid input). User Interface: Develop a simple text-based menu to interact with the #system.
